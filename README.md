# Simple Color Memory Game
<hr>
This is a simple python console game like the color memory kids game. Using simple strings and ANSI Color Codes, this game has been recreated in Python.

## Purpose
<hr>
my goals for this are as follows:
* get back into coding
* continue to build my portfolio

## Final Thoughts
<hr>
This was a pretty fun one, I enjoyed doing it and i feel like i did a good job of working around some things. I also learned about ANSI Escape Code, which creates color in the terminal. Always learning!

# How to Use
<hr>
1) Download the python file to somewhere on your computer
2) Using *CMD* or an *IDE*, run the file and follow the directions in the terminal!
	1) If using CMD
		1) Copy the File Path
		2) Go into terminal and type 'cd {file path}'
		3) Then type 'python colorGame.py'
3) Enjoy!
